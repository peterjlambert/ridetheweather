	<p>&hellip;and whilst it might be my fault (it's probably my fault), it might be your fault too. I don't know. I'm not that clever. Have you checked you got the URL right?</p>
	<p>If it is my fault (it probably is) then I'm really sorry for even implying that you might be even partially to blame. By way of an apology, please accept this current forecast for somewhere lovely.</p>
